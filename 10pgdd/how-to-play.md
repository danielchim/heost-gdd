    This is the place where the player will wait for a round of game, and manage their vehicle and equipment.

However players can upgrade their houses to higher tier apartments.

    Where the main heist happens. In the GTA V world, there are multiple banks are available to diffent heist mission. During a heist, robber team need to control the crownd, and try to reach to the vault. One thing to note is that in each bank there are different combinations of vault opening methods. For instance, some vault doors required a keycard to bypass while some require a keypad. The hacker role need to decide what to pick up when preparation.

## Vehicles

Vechicles takes a major role in the gameplay. Robbers need vehicles to escape while the cops need the vehicle to catch the robbers. Each vehicle has 3 properties: HP, speed and storage capacity. HP determines the health of the vehicle. If the HP value drops to 0, the vehicle will explode. Then there is speed, which is self-explaintory, determine how fast the vehicle could go. And finally the storage capacity. The storage capacity will determine how many items or loot could be stored inside a vehicle.

 There are multiple vehicle classes available for player to choose.
