Project Name: Heist

Role Required: looking for individuals with experience in GTA V / fiveM modding

My Role: As well as project manager (I'd like to pride myself on being more lenient than any manager you'll ever have elsewhere)

My Previous Projects: N/A

Team Size: Currently in the single digits, approximately 4 iirc, but I'm hoping to raise that number to at least 30 happy collaborators if possible.

Project Length: Until it's done (I'd rather not force workers to crunch to meet a deadline)

Compensation: A portion of the profits, divided based on necessity of work (while it's a f2p game concept, profits will come in the form of cosmetic microtransactions and time-savers)

Responsibilities: will vary depending on your role in the project

Project Description: A class-based FPS with RTS aspects. it can be best described as a combination of Call of Duty, Overwatch, and StarCraft 2. Story details can be given elsewhere, for the safety of the (currently unprotected) intellectual property.
